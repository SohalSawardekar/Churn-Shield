# 🚀 Churn Shield

---

## 📌 Overview

Churn Shield is a predictive analytics platform that helps banks analyze customer behavior and forecast their likelihood of churning. By leveraging machine learning, banks can assess the risk associated with a particular customer and make informed decisions on loans, offers, and retention strategies.

This allows financial institutions to **minimize risk** and **personalize customer engagement** based on predictive insights.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The model used for predictions is trained on a limited dataset, and results may not always be accurate. Predictions should be used as supporting insights rather than definitive decisions.
